# [RPG GAME] Animate and Move a Character Sprite (Custom React Hooks)

In this screencast we will be using a couple of sprite sets to display a player character on the screen, and then we will build some custom React hooks to animate that character around a simple grassland. All of this lays the groundwork for expanding this series later into towns, items, and combat!

This repository contains the code that I based an episode of DevmentorLive on. You can find the episode at: [[RPG GAME] Animate and Move a Character Sprite (Custom React Hooks))](https://devmentor.live/screencasts/rpg-game-animate-and-move-a-character-sprite-custom-react-hooks)
